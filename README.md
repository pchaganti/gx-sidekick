Chat with a local LLM that can respond with information from your files, folders and websites on your Mac without installing any other software. All conversations happen offline, and your data stays secure. Sidekick is a <strong>local first</strong> application –– with a built in inference engine for local models, while accommodating OpenAI compatible APIs for additional model options.

## Example Use

Let’s say you're collecting evidence for a History paper about interactions between Aztecs and Spanish troops, and you’re looking for text about whether the Aztecs used captured Spanish weapons.

![Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/johnbean393/Sidekick/refs/heads/main/Docs%20Images/Features/Experts/demoHistoryScreenshot.png)

Here, you can ask Sidekick, “Did the Aztecs use captured Spanish weapons?”, and it responds with direct quotes with page numbers and a brief analysis.

To verify Sidekick’s answer, just click on the references displayed below Sidekick’s answer, and the academic paper referenced by Sidekick immediately opens in your viewer.

## Features

Read more about Sidekick's features and how to use them [here](https://johnbean393.github.io/Sidekick/).

### Resource Use

Sidekick accesses files, folders, and websites from your experts, which can be individually configured to contain resources related to specific areas of interest. Activating an expert allows Sidekick to fetch and reference materials as needed.

Because Sidekick uses RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation), you can theoretically put unlimited resources into each expert, and Sidekick will still find information relevant to your request to aid its analysis.

For example, a student might create the experts `English Literature`, `Mathematics`, `Geography`, `Computer Science` and `Physics`. In the image below, he has activated the expert `Computer Science`.

Users can also give Sidekick access to files just by dragging them into the input field.

Sidekick can even respond with the latest information using **web search**, speeding up research.

### Bring Your Own API Key

In addition to its core local-first capabilities, Sidekick now offers an option to bring your own key for OpenAI compatible APIs. This allows you to tap into additional remote models while still preserving a primarily local-first workflow.

### Reasoning Model Support

Sidekick supports a variety of reasoning models, including Alibaba Cloud's QwQ-32B and DeepSeek's DeepSeek-R1.

### Function Calling

Sidekick can call functions to boost the mathematical and logical capabilities of models, and to execute actions. Functions are called sequentially in a loop until a result is obtained.

For example, when asking Sidekick to reverse a string or do arithmetic operation, it runs tools, then presents the result.

### Canvas

Create, edit and preview websites, code and other textual content using Canvas.

![Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/johnbean393/Sidekick/refs/heads/main/Docs%20Images/Features/Canvas/canvasWebsite.png)

Select parts of the text, then prompt the chatbot to perform selective edits.

### Image Generation

Sidekick can generate images from text, allowing you to create visual aids for your work. 

There are no buttons, no switches to flick, no `Image Generation` mode. Instead, a built-in CoreML model **automatically identifies** image generation prompts, and generates an image when necessary.

![Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/johnbean393/Sidekick/refs/heads/main/Docs%20Images/Features/Image%20Generation/imageGeneration.png)

Image generation is available on macOS 15.2 or above, and requires Apple Intelligence.

### Advanced Markdown Rendering

Markdown is rendered beautifully in Sidekick.

#### LaTeX

Sidekick offers native LaTeX rendering for mathematical equations.

#### Data Visualization

Visualizations are automatically generated for tables when appropriate, with a variety of charts available, including bar charts, line charts and pie charts.

![Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/johnbean393/Sidekick/refs/heads/main/Docs%20Images/Features/Conversations/dataVisualization2.png)

Charts can be dragged and dropped into third party apps.

#### Code

Code is beautifully rendered with syntax highlighting, and can be exported or copied at the click of a button.

![Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/johnbean393/Sidekick/refs/heads/main/Docs%20Images/Features/Conversations/codeExport.png)

### Toolbox

Use **Tools** in Sidekick to supercharge your workflow.

#### Inline Writing Assistant

Press `Command + Control + I` to access Sidekick's inline writing assistant. For example, use the `Answer Question` command to do your homework without leaving Microsoft Word!

![Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/johnbean393/Sidekick/refs/heads/main/Docs%20Images/Features/Tools/Inline%20Writing%20Assistant/inlineWritingAssistantCommands.png)

Use the default keyboard shortcut `Tab` to accept suggestions for the next word, or `Shift + Tab` to accept all suggested words. View a demo [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DDzdNHid7MwIDz4tgTpnqSA-fuBCajQA/preview).

### Fast Generation

Sidekick uses `llama.cpp` as its inference backend, which is optimized to deliver lightning fast generation speeds on Apple Silicon. It also supports speculative decoding, which can further improve the generation speed.

![Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/johnbean393/Sidekick/refs/heads/main/Docs%20Images/Features/Local%20Models/speculativeDecodingSupport.png)

Optionally, you can offload generation to speed up processing while extending the battery life of your MacBook.
